# Hacking-Android-Apps-101

To get started with you will need an Android device which is running any version above 4.4. I will be using an rooted Nexus 6 running Android 7.1 for the demos. You won't need a rooted for the most part of this session but it is good to have one! If you don't have an Android device, I recommend using GenyMotion emulator. This emulator works much better than the one that ships with Android Studio.
